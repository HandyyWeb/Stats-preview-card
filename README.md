<ins>My process</ins> :

Built with :

- Semantic HTML5 ( main / picture / source )
- CSS rules ( @media / @font-family)
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS filter properties

<ins>What I learned</ins> : 

This fourth project wasn't so difficult, it allowed me to train my use of semantic HTML5 (like `main` / `article`) and I tried to organise my CSS file better, but I think that soon I will have to learn the BEM methodology for naming CSS classes.
I learned how to use filter properties, in particular how to use the `hue-rotate()` property, because in a first time I was not able to apply the `hue-rotate` property directly to the image, so I had to make an association of `sepia()` and `saturate`... a bit though, but now I know !
  
<ins>Continued develoment</ins>:

I still need to work on the CSS filter properties, of course, and the layout can also be optimised, but now that I'm on my fourth project, I need to start being more aware of optimisation in HTML5 and CSS (using the BEM methodology for example), and I also need to start using CSS tricks to reduce the length of my css code, in fact I need to become more conscious of how I code in the future.
